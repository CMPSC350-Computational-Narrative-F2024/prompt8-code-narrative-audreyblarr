## 1. Prompts Used

Try at least three variations and use the same final prompts for both Copilot and another LLM

- "Generate a series of Python-style functions that reflect teamwork and collaboration. Examples of collaboration may include functions that interact with one another or share data." (few-shot)
- "Generate a series of Python-style functions that reflect teamwork and collaboration. There should be three separate Python functions: the first two as individual functions and a third utilizing the first two functions in collaboration. After the three functions, there should be a use case of the above functions to demonstrate the collaboration." (chain of thought)
- "Generate a series of Python-style functions that reflect teamwork and collaboration. There should be three separate Python functions: the first two as individual functions and a third utilizing the first two functions in collaboration. After the three functions, there should be a use case of the above functions to demonstrate the collaboration. Ensure each function is present and includes enough specifics to serve as executable Python code." (chaining)

## 2. Prompting Strategy

TODO: What was your strategy with prompting. What worked and what didn't work? Did you employ a specific prompting technique (zero-, few-, many-shot, chaining, chain of thought, meta prompting)?

## 3. Output Evaluation

For each generated code output, consider:
    - Narrative Structure: How does the organization reflect the theme? Is there a clear flow that resembles a narrative?
    - Commentary and Documentation: How do Copilotâ€™s comments contribute to the narrative? Do they add meaning to the code?
    - Design Choices: Evaluate how Copilot's naming conventions, variable usage, and logic choices enhance or detract from the narrative.

## 4. Reflection

TODO: How did your prompt iterations impacted the narrative quality of the generated code? How did Copilot's suggestions supported or hindered the story within the code?
